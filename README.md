Description:
This Web application asks the user to enter a word and returns the Scrabble score of the word. Lower case characters will be converted to upper case. The Scrabble scores per letter are as follows:

* 1:  A, E, I, O, U, L, N, R, S, T
* 2:  D, G
* 3:  B, C, M, P
* 4:  F, H, V, W, Y
* 5:  K
* 8:  J, X
* 10: Q, Z

Per the official Scrabble rules, nothing but letters can be used. Words with apostrophes and hyphens are not allowed, and a blank tile cannot be used to represent an apostrophe or a hyphen. Thus the input functionality will flag the input with a red box border, red label, and red x glyphicon. Legal input will be flagged with a green box border, green label, and green check glyphicon.
